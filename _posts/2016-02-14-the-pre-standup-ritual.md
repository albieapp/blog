##  A standup is most effective when each member is prepared - including the Scrum Master.

Each morning, before the standup, I ask myself a series of questions to help me find out as much information as possible:

- Is anyone on holiday today?
- Do announcements or reminders need communicated?
- Are any experiments in progress from the Retrospective?
- Have any stories entered the sprint without permission?
- Are any stories blocked or requiring feedback?
- Is anything close to completion?
- Can we demo new functionality?
- Who's working on each task?
- Who's lacking feature work?
- Is the build passing?

I absorb answers to these questions from Information Radiators at the start of the day. By doing this, I can maintain a focus on goals within a team during the standup instead of worrying about holiday-cover or how to resolve a particular impediment.

Alistair Cockburn described Information Radiators as:

> A display posted in a place where people can see it as they work or walk by. It shows readers information they care about without having to ask anyone a question. This means more communication with fewer interruptions.

Next time you facilitate a standup, spend a few moments absorbing information from your Information Radiators. Focus your team's attention less on status updating and more towards creating a plan for a successful day.
