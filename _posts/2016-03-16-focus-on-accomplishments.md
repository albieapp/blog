## I've previously blogged about [dropping _'yesterdays'_ from the daily scrum](http://blog.albie.io/dropping-yesterdays-a-standup-question-experiment) questions in an attempt to shift focus away from status reporting.

The question was quickly re-added after it was agreed the experiment was having a negative impact on communication. With the team being distributed, and communication naturally being challenging, the impact was far outweighing the gain.

The problem however, still remained.

Each member of a scrum team is typically asked to answer the following three questions:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Is anything in your way?

It wasn't until a recent email conversation with [Mike Cohn](https://twitter.com/mikewcohn) that I began to suspect the "default questions" could be part of the problem. Mike said:

> "When the questions are reworded to focus on accomplishments rather than activity, it becomes clear that the team values progress"

We tried the following questions:

- What did you accomplish yesterday?
- What will you accomplish today?
- Is anything in your way?

The team's daily scrum now focuses more on what each person accomplished instead of what they were doing. This emphasises progress and reduces the expectation of giving a generic status update to the rest of the team.

If your team are experiencing similar issues - try changing your questions to focus on accomplishments. And don't for get to tweet us at [@albieio](https://twitter.com/albieio) to let us know if this works out for your team!
