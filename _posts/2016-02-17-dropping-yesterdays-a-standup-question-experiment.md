## Recently I ran an experiment with a distributed software team where "yesterdays" were dropped from the regular set of standup questions.

The reason we tried this was to reduce the expectation that a standup was a place solely for reporting status. Over time, the team had slipped into a habit of focusing the majority of time communicating "what was done". Not enough time was spent synchronizing and creating a plan of action for the day. This resulted in less attention on accomplishing the Sprint Goal and determining if the team was still on track to complete the Increment as planned.

The experiment ran for a single sprint - two weeks. However, I was surprised how quickly I knew the experiment was failing. Even though it succeeded in terms of helping the team refocus on the Increment, not celebrating even the most minor achievements was greatly missed. At the next Retrospective we decided to re-introduce "yesterdays" to the daily standup.

For the next few weeks, I reflected on what we learned, but it wasn't until a conversation with James McGivern, [Mike Pearce](https://twitter.com/MikePearce) and [Stephen Vance](https://twitter.com/StephenRVance) that I finally managed to understand why we were feeling the need to celebrate the small wins. James said:

> "I think yesterdays are less useful when a story progresses across most of the board in a day, because the board itself tells the story"

This was very thought-provoking. It made me understand the reason the team needed to report their status was because not everyone was on the same page. I soon realised this due to the team working remotely.

When a team is co-located, a Board serves as an Information Radiator. Developers can see when one of their colleagues walks up and makes a change to the board. Status is constantly communicated and absorbed without distraction or the need for conversation. Cards move across the board and tell the team's story.

Distributed teams do not share a location. They don't share a wall for their board and can't ensure it's in view to the whole team at all times. Software attempts to solve this problem, but it is a tough challenge to communicate change without notifications being an interruption. It's a tough challenge when change can be easily missed. It's tough for any piece of software to be as efficient and effective as a physical board.

Communication for remote teams is significantly harder than those that share an office. Everyone must be aware of this and ensure changes and decisions are communicated effectively. By taking few moments at the start of the day to share what each team member worked on "yesterday", we ensure important information is communicated - along with celebrating the small wins!

Even though this experiment didn't technically work, valuable lessons were learned. We learned that Information Radiators may not be as effective for distributed teams. We can't solely rely on them to tell the whole story. Due to this, we synchronize our understandings, in just a few moments, at the start of each day.
