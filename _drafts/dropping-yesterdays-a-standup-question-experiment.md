## Recently I ran an experiment with a distributed software team where "yesterdays" were dropped from the regular set of standup questions.

The reason we tried this was to reduce the expectation that a standup was primarily a place to give a status report. Over time, the team had slipped into a habit of focusing the majority of time communicating on "what was done" instead of synchronising and creating a plan of action for the day. Because of this, not enough attention was given to how they would accomplish the Sprint Goal or determining if they were still on track to complete the Increment as planned.

The experiment ran for a single sprint - two weeks. However, I was surprised how quickly I knew the experiment was a failure. Even though it succeeded in terms of helping the team refocus on the Increment, celebrating even the most minor achievements was greatly missed. At the next Retrospective we decided to re-introduce "yesterdays" to the daily standup.

For the next few weeks, I reflected on what we learned, but it wasn't until a conversation within [#agile](http://hashtagagile.com/) with [James McGivern](?), [Mike Pearce](https://twitter.com/MikePearce) and [Stephen Vance](https://twitter.com/StephenRVance) that I finally managed to understand why we were feeling the need to celebrate the small wins.

This insight was very thought-provoking and made me realise that the reason the team needed to report their status was actually because they worked remotely.

When a team is co-located, a Board serves as an Information Radiator. Developers can see when one of their colleagues walks up and makes a change to the board. Status is constantly communicated and absorbed without distraction or the need for conversation. Cards move across the board and tell the story of the team.

Distributed teams do not share a location. They don't share a wall for their board and can't ensure it's in view to the whole team at all times. It doesn't matter how hard software attempts to solve this problem, it will never be as efficient as communicating status change as a physical board. Notifications will interrupt and change will be missed.

Even though this experiment didn't
