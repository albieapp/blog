##  A standup is most effective when each member is prepared - including the Scrum Master.

Each morning, before the standup, I ask myself a series of questions to help me find out as much information as possible:

- Is anyone on holiday today?
- Do announcements or reminders need communicated?
- Are any experiments in progress from the Retrospective?
- Have any stories entered the sprint without permission?
- Are any stories blocked or requiring feedback?
- Is anything close to completion?
- Can we demo new functionality?
- Who's working on each task?
- Who's lacking feature work?
- Is the build passing?

I absorb answers to these questions from Information Radiators because it helps to maintain the teams focus on our goals during the standup.
